# Simple Clicker RPG v1.2 - Bug Fix Report

This document provides a comprehensive overview of all bugs and issues identified during code review of the Simple Clicker RPG v1.2 project, along with the implemented fixes.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Damage Calculation Bug
**Issue:** In the `dealDamage()` function, the HP subtraction was incorrect. The function calculated the actual damage as `Math.min(amount, state.enemyCurrentHP)` but then used the original `amount` to reduce the HP, potentially causing negative HP values.

**Fix:** Modified the function to use `actualAmount` when reducing enemy HP. This ensures that enemy HP never goes below zero due to damage calculation.

```javascript
// Before:
const actualAmount = Math.min(amount, state.enemyCurrentHP);
state.enemyCurrentHP -= amount;

// After:
const actualAmount = Math.min(amount, state.enemyCurrentHP);
state.enemyCurrentHP -= actualAmount;
```

### 2. Duplicate Code
**Issue:** The code contained duplicate `saveGame()` and `loadGame()` functions defined in two different places.

**Fix:** Removed the duplicate functions, keeping only one implementation of each.

### 3. DPS Threshold Problem
**Issue:** In `applyDPS()`, there was a check that prevented damage less than 0.1, making early-game helper purchases feel worthless.

**Fix:** Removed the threshold check, allowing all DPS to be applied regardless of amount.

```javascript
// Before:
if (damagePerTick >= 0.1) {
    dealDamage(damagePerTick, false, true);
}

// After:
dealDamage(damagePerTick, false, true);
```

### 4. Prestige Achievement Preservation Logic
**Issue:** During prestige, only explicitly named prestige achievements were preserved.

**Fix:** Improved the logic to preserve all prestige-related achievements, catching achievements by ID prefix, explicit naming, and description content:

```javascript
// Before:
if (a.id === 'prestigeReady') {
    a.achieved = true; 
} else if (a.id === 'firstPrestige') {
    a.achieved = achievementStates[i];
} else {
    a.achieved = false;
}

// After:
if (a.id.startsWith('prestige') || 
    a.id === 'firstPrestige' || 
    a.desc.toLowerCase().includes('prestige')) {
    a.achieved = achievementStates[i];
} else {
    a.achieved = false;
}
```

## Game Balance Issues Fixed

### 1. Gold Scaling vs HP Scaling
**Issue:** Enemy HP scaled at 1.16 per level while gold scaled at only 1.06, creating an increasingly steep difficulty curve.

**Fix:** 
- Increased gold scaling factor from 1.06 to 1.10
- Increased boss gold multiplier from 4 to 4.5
- Increased the level bonus multiplier from 0.2 to 0.3 per level

### 2. Achievement Reward Consistency
**Issue:** Some achievements gave percentage-based bonuses by multiplication (multiply by 1.X) while others used addition (add 0.X), causing inconsistent scaling.

**Fix:** Standardized all achievement bonuses to use addition, ensuring consistent growth:

```javascript
// Before (inconsistent):
state.achievementHelperDamageMultiplier *= 1.07;  // Multiplication
state.achievementGoldMultiplier += 0.10;         // Addition

// After (standardized):
state.achievementHelperDamageMultiplier += 0.07;  // All use addition
state.achievementGoldMultiplier += 0.10;
```

### 3. Prestige Star Calculation
**Issue:** Stars were calculated as `Math.floor(state.enemyLevel / 25)` with a minimum of 1, creating an abrupt "stair-step" reward where progressing from level 25 to level 49 provided no additional benefit.

**Fix:** Implemented a more gradual star calculation that includes partial progress between major thresholds:

```javascript
// Before:
return Math.max(1, Math.floor(state.enemyLevel / 25));

// After:
const fullStars = Math.floor(state.enemyLevel / 25);
const partialProgress = (state.enemyLevel % 25) / 25;
const partialStar = partialProgress > 0 ? Math.floor(partialProgress * 10) / 10 : 0;
return Math.max(1, fullStars + partialStar);
```

## UI & Feedback Issues Fixed

### 1. Small Damage Popup Filtering
**Issue:** Damage popups for small amounts (<0.1) were filtered out, causing player confusion when dealing small damage but seeing no visual feedback.

**Fix:** Removed the filter and improved the display of small values with better decimal precision:

```javascript
// Before:
if (amount < 0.1 && !isDPS) return;
const amountStr = isCrit ? formatNumber(amount) : (amount < 5 ? amount.toFixed(1) : formatNumber(amount));

// After:
const amountStr = isCrit ? formatNumber(amount) : (amount < 1 ? amount.toFixed(2) : (amount < 5 ? amount.toFixed(1) : formatNumber(amount)));
```

## Code Structure & Error Handling Improvements

### 1. Error Handling
**Issue:** There was minimal error handling in critical functions like `updateDisplay()`.

**Fix:** Added try/catch blocks to critical functions with appropriate error logging and recovery mechanisms.

```javascript
function updateDisplay() {
    try {
        // Function code...
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error in updateDisplay:', error);
        // Recovery code...
    }
}
```

## Summary of Changes

1. **Gameplay Integrity**
   - Fixed damage calculation to prevent negative HP
   - Standardized achievement bonuses for balanced progression
   - Improved prestige system with more gradual rewards
   - Enhanced gold scaling to match enemy HP growth

2. **Code Quality**
   - Removed code duplication
   - Added error handling for critical functions
   - Fixed variable usages and data consistency

3. **User Experience**
   - Improved feedback for small DPS values
   - Fixed visual indicators for damage
   - Made early helper purchases more immediately rewarding

These changes improve the overall game integrity, fix logical bugs, and create a more balanced progression system for players.
